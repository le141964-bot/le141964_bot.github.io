                    <blockquote>
                        Lot of bark but not very much bite. It came across as a kind of daytime soap opera version showing the personalities of
                        the player rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what really happened. Even that would not have been so bad but the movie
                        tries to protray lots of these folks as sympatheic figures just trying to do the right thing.

                     I am watching this for the 3rd time. trying to understand how this large group fo capitalist pigs could royally screw their
                     families, descendants, neighbors, countrymen and the rest of the whole world with aboslutely no compassion.
